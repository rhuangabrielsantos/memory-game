## About Project

My goal in creating the project was to help the school where my sister studies, promoting a place where teachers can use to relax their students in this period of social isolation.

The next step is to add functionality where teachers can create their own memory game to help them learn their subjects.

## Technologies

In the project I used React.js, with framer motion for the animations, tailwind css for the style and for controlling the game rules, I decided to separate the modes.

Currently, there are two game modes, for single player redux was used to control the application states and for multiplayer was used the realtime database of firebase.
